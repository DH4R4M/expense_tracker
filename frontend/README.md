# React + Vite Expense Tracker

This project is a simple Expense Tracker application built with React and Vite. It includes features like adding, editing, and deleting expenses, as well as visualizing monthly trends.

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete expenses
- View total expenses and monthly trends
- Responsive design
- Fast Refresh with Vite

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm or yarn

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```

   Or using yarn:

3. **Start the development server:**

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
